# Shamebot

An iOS app that detects when a user opens Instagram and displays a shame message generated by AI.

## About This Demo Version

This version of Shamebot has been simplified to work without requiring special entitlements or an Apple Developer account. It simulates Instagram detection by periodically checking if it should trigger a "shame" message (once every 5 seconds in the demo).

### Features

- Simulates Instagram detection for demo purposes
- Generates AI shame messages using OpenAI's API
- Shows a full-screen overlay with the shame message
- Provides fallback messages if API integration is not set up

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Basic Setup
- [ ] Open the project in Xcode
- [ ] Run on an iOS simulator or device (iOS 14.0+)

### 2. OpenAI API Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Create an OpenAI account at https://openai.com
- [ ] Generate an API key from your OpenAI dashboard
- [ ] Add your API key to `ShameGenerator.swift` in the `apiKey` property
- [ ] Without an API key, the app will use local fallback messages

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Run the app
- [ ] Wait for a few seconds - the app will periodically simulate Instagram detection
- [ ] When "Instagram is detected," you'll see a shame message overlay
- [ ] Tap "I'll do better" to dismiss the overlay

## Implementation Notes

### Simulation Mode
- This demo version simulates Instagram detection every 5 seconds
- Real detection would require Screen Time API and special entitlements

### OpenAI Integration
- The app makes API calls when Instagram is detected
- If no API key is provided, it uses local fallback messages
- Add your API key to test the AI-generated messages feature

### Future Improvements
For a production-ready version with actual Instagram detection:
- Add Apple Developer account with Screen Time entitlements
- Implement proper FamilyControls APIs
- Add proper error handling and recovery
- Implement secure storage for API keys

### Implementation Challenges
- The Screen Time API requires special permissions and entitlements
- Full detection requires an active Apple Developer account
- The Screen Time API is still evolving and documentation can be limited

## Technical Notes

- The app uses SwiftUI for the interface
- Uses Combine for reactive programming
- Simulates app detection with timers
- Includes OpenAI API integration for dynamic messages

## Security Notes
- Never commit your OpenAI API key to version control
- Consider implementing a more secure key storage solution for production
- The sample implementation is for demonstration purposes only
